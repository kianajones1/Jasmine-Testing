# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. We were instructed to finish the rest of the test suites using our knowledge of Jasmine and Javascript

## How to run application

Download the zip file and then open the index.html file to your browser.

# Steps to successfully run the application 

We tested that allFeeds have been defined and were not empty. We then made sure that the allFeeds have a URL and that also is not empty. Then we tested allFeeds had a name and that the name was not empty.

Next, we looked at the Javascript to find the "menu-hidden" tag to test that it is hidden by default. We then tested that the menu toggles on and off with the click event if the menu hides or shows. 

Finally, we tested if the loadFeed function has at least a single .entry within the .feed container and tested to see if two entreies are not equal.
